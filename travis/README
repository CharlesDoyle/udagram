This travis folder is for extra .travis.yml files that I want to stash
away from being directly in the udagram/ directory.  The .travis.yml file 
in the udagram/.travis.yml path gets run by Travis if it is in a master-branch
commit.  Some reasons one may want to stash a .travis.yml file in here are
to preserve a different .travis.yml file that could be used later, or to 
keep the currently-used .travis.yml file out of udagram/ directory, so it
doesn't trigger a Travis build on a commit.
Stash extra .travis.yml files in this travis/ directory, and rename them
to something like .travis1.yml and .travis2.yml if there is more than one.  
To use a .travis.yml file, move it to udagram/.travis.yml (and put a file
not being used in this travis/ directory).
